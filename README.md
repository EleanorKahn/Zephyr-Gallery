# Welcome to Zephyr Gallery

## Purpose

- work with a REST api
- deploy using netlify 

## What I used
- react, react-dom 18.2.0
- netlify functions 1.6.0
- netlify cli 15.10.0
- node-fetch 3.3.2
- autoprefixer 10.4.14
- postcss 10.1.0
- tailwindcss 3.2.7
- node 16.13.2

## Deploying to Netlify
Configure netlify functions to call your api.

# Getting Started with Create React App

## Acknowledgements 
Many thanks to Nick for his help troubleshooting serverless functions. 

### Notes
This was originally a Brad Traversy project that I screenshot and recreated from my images. I ended up being pretty close, and the only things I ended up having to correct were some of the text size and some of the padding/margins.
